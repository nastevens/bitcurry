        <h1>Switching to zsh</h1>
        <p>The other day, I was working with a coworker on some code, and he made
          a seemingly innocuous comment: "oh, you're still using bash instead of
          zsh." I was taken aback at first - sure, I had heard of the zsh project
          and the seeming flagship of the effort, oh-my-zsh. But I had my bash
          set up the way I liked it, with customized PS1, aliases, completions
          for the tools I used, and automatic updates of my dotfiles through a
          GitHub repository.</p>

        <p>Still, the comment stuck with me. I had never given zsh a chance, so
          maybe now was the time. So I installed zsh, cloned oh-my-zsh, and got
          to work customizing my zsh configuration with all the comforts I knew
          in bash.</p>

        <p>Here is the part where a lot of zsh articles might talk about a
          come-to-enlightenment moment. The heavens parted, angels sang, and zsh
          was bestowed upon them. What I experienced was the feeling that I had
          upgraded bash from 4.x to 5.x - a bunch of really new features that I
          appreciated, but nothing that was earth shattering.</p>

    printf("Hello\n");
